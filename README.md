# TSP-PROBLEM
PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
The Traveling Salesman Problem aims to find the shortest path to travel all the cities on his route.
PREPARING 
Fort his project, first we look the algortihms that we can use to implement the code. In the inputs that are given to us there are both big and smaller datas. So we should use an algorithm that is proper for all data sizes. We selected Nearest Neighbor Algorithm and 2-Opt Algorithm for writing the code.
